The motherboard serves as a single platform to connect all of the parts of a computer together. It can be considered as the backbone of the computer.

It connects the CPU, Memory, Hard drives, Optical drives, Video card, Sound card, and other parts. It also connects Expansion cards directly or via cables. 

A computer is an electronic device that processes the data with respect to the userâ€™s requirements using IO devices. The data processing takes place in a processor, an important component. The processor is situated in a hardware circuit board called the motherboard or Printed Circuit Board(PCB). 

 
 Components of Motherboard
 A motherboard is made of plastic and silicon as well. It is a hub of a computer system. A motherboard is a complex component with various kinds of ports, slots, cables connected to it. 
Some of them are: 
 

RAM slots(Random Access Memory): Also called as main memory, it is a primary storage device for storage huge bytes of data.
CPU Fan and HeatSink: Its main function is to cool down the CPU by absorbing the heat while the system is running.
North bridge: Due to its location, it is referred to as Northbridge.
South bridge: Controls the Input and Output functions.
Capacitors: Data storage
Resistors: Data storage
CMOS battery(Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor): A battery that provides backup power.
PCI Slots(Peripheral Component Interconnect): Connects the peripherals.
SATA cables(Serial Advanced Technology Attachment): Data transfer
BIOS(Basic Input Output System): Controls the basic input-output functions.
Processor: the main component for the data processing.
AGP(Accelerated Graphics Port): For displaying graphics on the screen.
IDE(Integrated Drive Electronics): Used for data transfer.
Processor socket: To insert or remove the processor.
Integrated Circuits (IC): for data processing and storage.

what is cpu and it's mode of operation of cpu.

CPU is the brain of the computer. All types of data processing operations and all the important functions of a computer are performed by the CPU. It helps input and output devices to communicate with each other and perform their respective operations. It also stores data which is input, intermediate results in between processing, and instructions. 

Now, the CPU consists of 3 major units, which are:

Memory or Storage Unit
Control Unit
ALU(Arithmetic Logic Unit)
